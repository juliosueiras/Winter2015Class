# afdsmgrd.cf.example - example configuration file for afdsmgrd.
#
# by Dario Berzano <dario.berzano@cern.ch>
#
# afdsmgrd is able to parse variables and needs to read the xpd.datasetsrc
# directive(s), so it is a good idea to merge this configuration with PROOF's
# one.
#

# Configuration file for afdsmgrd supports environment variables: in this
# example we set PMASTER to the PROOF master and xrootd redirector
set PMASTER=pmaster.to.infn.it

# This is the standard PROOF directive that tells PROOF where to find the
# datasets repository. For now afdsmgrd only supports dataset sources of type
# "file", which means on a local filesystem. The syntax is:
#
# xpd.datasetsrc file url:<local_path> mss:<redir_path:port> opt:<opts> <rw=1>
#
# where some opts are: Cq (check quota), Av (allow verify), Ar (allow register).
# Options can be prefixed with a minus to exclude them.
#xpd.datasetsrc file url:/pool/datasets mss:root://$PMASTER:1094 opt:Cq:Av:Ar: rw=1

# This directive is alternative to xpd.datasetsrc. It is shared with PROOF. It
# points to an ordinary data repository with open permissions to the world,
# which is supposed to be used as a temporary place where to store staging
# requests.
xpd.stagereqrepo /pool/datasets

# Set it to true (default is false) to remove a dataset when no file to stage
# is found. If no file to stage is found, but corrupted files exist, the
# dataset is kept to signal failures. Used in combination with xpd.stagereqrepo
# makes it "disposable": only the datasets effectively needed for signaling
# the staging status will be kept, improving scalability and stability.
#dsmgrd.purgenoopds true

# Regex and substitution pattern that will be used to translate the URLs. The
# regex is interpreted as extended, and substitution pattern interprets
# "dollar" substitutions from $1 to $9. If the n-th submatch (as in $n) is not
# defined in regex, it will be substituted with "<?>"; instead, if the n-th
# submatch did not match anything, it will be just an empty string
dsmgrd.urlregex alien://(.*)$ root://$PMASTER/$1

# Additional matching regular expressions (up to 4) can be specified using the
# same syntax; numbering of additional regexs starts from 2. Regexs are used
# in the same order they appear here: if a regex does not match (or is not set)
# the next one is tested
#dsmgrd.urlregex2 root://myserver.cern.ch/(.*)$ root://$PMASTER/$1
# ...up to dsmgrd.urlregex4

# At each loop the transfer queue is checked: sleep time between each loop, in
# seconds
dsmgrd.sleepsecs 30

# Every certain number of loops the information in the transfer queue is
# synchronized with the information inside the datasets
dsmgrd.scandseveryloops 10

# Maximum number of parallel staging commands to launch. For consistency, set it
# to the number of servers * the number of parallel transfers for each server
# (see oss.xfr). To accommodate some delay betwen a transfer's end and the
# beginning of a new transfer, think about adding some "overbooking"
dsmgrd.parallelxfrs 30

# Custom command to stage and verify a single file. $URLTOSTAGE will be
# substituted with the file's URL when staging: URLs with anchors are supported.
# Another variable, $TREENAME, will be substituted with the default tree to
# look for.
#
# The default command is a script that runs in sequence xrdstagetool, then if
# everything is fine it runs the macros/Verify.C macro to gather meta
# information on the staged file.
dsmgrd.stagecmd @DIR_LIBEXEC@/afdsmgrd-xrd-stage-verify.sh "$URLTOSTAGE" "$TREENAME"

# Timeout on staging command, expressed in seconds: after this timeout, the
# command is considered failed and it is killed (in first place with SIGSTOP,
# then if it is unresponsive with SIGKILL). It defaults to zero, which means
# "no timeout", i.e. external command may run forever, if no value is
# specified. A recommended value of 30 minutes is given in this example.
dsmgrd.cmdtimeoutsecs 1800

# Set this to a number above zero to tell the daemon to mark files as corrupted
# after a certain number of either download or verification failures. A value of
# zero tells the daemon to retry forever.
#dsmgrd.corruptafterfails 0

#
# Notification plugin: MonALISA (ApMon)
#

# Path to the notification plugin library: in this case, ApMon is used, but
# custom plugins may be easily written as well
dsmgrd.notifyplugin @DIR_LIB@/libafdsmgrd_notify_apmon.so

# This variable tells the ApMon notification plugin how to contact one or more
# MonALISA server(s) to activate monitoring via ApMon. It supports two kinds of
# URLs:
#
#   http[s]://host/path/configuration_file.conf
#   apmon://[:password@]monalisahost[:8884]
#
# This means that you may pass either a file where to fetch the list of servers
# or directly a single server.
#
# If the variable is not set, yet the plugin is loaded, MonALISA monitoring is
# inhibited until a valid configuration variable is provided.
#dsmgrd.apmonurl apmon://alibox.to.infn.it

# Since MonALISA organizes information in "clusters" and "hosts", here you can
# specify what to use as cluster prefix for monitoring datasets information and
# daemon status. If this variable is not set, MonALISA monitoring is inhibited.
# Please note that the suffix "_datasets" or "_status" is appended for each of
# the two types of monitoring.
#dsmgrd.apmonprefix PROOF::TAF::STORAGE
