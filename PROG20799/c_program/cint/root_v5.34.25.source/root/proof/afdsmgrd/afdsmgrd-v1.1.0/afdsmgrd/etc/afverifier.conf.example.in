# Variable with name of redirector
set PMASTER=pmaster.to.infn.it

# Standard PROOF dataset source
xpd.datasetsrc file url:/pool/datasets mss:root://$PMASTER:1094 opt:Cq:Av:Ar: rw=1

# Originating URL will be converted to a destination URL (e.g, a redirector
# URL) according to the following regular expressions: the first one that
# matches is used. Regexs are tested in the same order they appear here.
# Apart from the first one, additional regexs are numbered from 2 to 4
verifier.urlregex alien://(.*)$ root://$PMASTER/$1
#dsmgrd.urlregex2 root://myserver.cern.ch/(.*)$ root://$PMASTER/$1

# Sleep between each queue check
verifier.sleepsecs 6

#Â Verified data on queue is saved on datasets every X seconds
verifier.scandseveryloops 10

# Parallel verifications: there is no upper limit, and it has been proven to
# handle thousands of elements. It is however better to keep this number not too
# high and to lower the "sleepsecs"
verifier.parallelverifies 800

# Command that performs the file verification -- variables will be substituted.
# With current distribution, you may choose between two different methods:
#
# 1) ROOT macro with option to do only locate (0) or rescan metadata (1)
#verifier.verifycmd @DIR_LIBEXEC@/afdsmgrd-root.sh -b -q @DIR_LIBEXEC@/afdsmgrd-macros/LocateVerifyXrd.C'("$REDIRURL", "$TREENAME", 0)'
#
# 2) External script that wraps "xrd locateall" (way faster and lighter): it
#    also performs a zipfile check directly on the server that has the file,
#    avoiding useless network transfers, but SSH without password must be
#    allowed. Pass the xrootd namespace or prefix (oss.localroot) with option
#    --xrd-prefix
verifier.verifycmd @DIR_LIBEXEC@/afverifier-xrd-locate.sh "$REDIRURL" --xrd-prefix /pool/my/namespace
#
# 3) Same thing as 2) but without zip check. Note that --no-zipcheck is the
#    second argument and cannot be swapped with the first one. Namespace is not
#    passed, so the default (/) will be used
#verifier.verifycmd @DIR_LIBEXEC@/afverifier-xrd-locate.sh "$REDIRURL" --no-zipcheck

# Command that performs the file removal on corrupted files, if requested by
# the user on command line (-x)
verifier.erasecmd @DIR_LIBEXEC@/afverifier-xrd-rm.sh "$REDIRURL"

# Maximum number of failures tolerated: verifications are failed after that
verifier.maxfailures 3
