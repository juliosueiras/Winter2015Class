2

• Describe the differences between a virus and a worm

• Identify different kinds of malware that is designed for profit

• Describe the types of social engineering psychological attacks

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• List the types of malware that conceals its appearance

• Explain physical social engineering attacks

3

• Malicious software (malware)
• Enters a computer system:
• Without the owner’s knowledge or consent

• Primary objectives of malware
• Infecting systems – rapidly spreading
• Concealing its purpose
• Making profit for creator

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Refers to a wide variety of damaging or annoying software

4

• Viruses
• Malicious computer code that reproduces itself on the same computer

• Appender infection
• Virus appends itself to end of a file
• Moves first three bytes of original file to virus code
• Replaces them with a jump instruction pointing to the virus code

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Virus infection methods

5

• Virus infection methods (cont’d.)
• Swiss cheese infection
• Viruses inject themselves into executable code
• Original code transferred and stored inside virus code
• Host code executes properly after the infection
•
•
•
•

Virus splits into several parts
Parts placed at random positions in host program
Head of virus code starts at beginning of file
Gives control to next piece of virus code

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Split infection

6

• When infected program is launched:
• Virus replicates itself by spreading to another file on same computer
• Virus activates its malicious payload
• Or be much more harmful

• Examples of virus actions
•
•
•
•

Cause a computer to repeatedly crash
Erase files from or reformat hard drive
Turn off computer’s security settings
Make multiple copies of itself until space is filled up in HDD.

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Viruses may display an annoying message:

• Virus cannot automatically spread to another computer
• Viruses are attached to files
• Viruses are spread by transferring infected files
• Two carriers:
• A file to which it attaches
• Human to transport it to other computers.

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Relies on user action to spread

9

• Types of computer viruses
• Program
• Infects executable files
• Executes a script

• Resident
• Virus infects files opened by user or operating system

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Macro

10

• Types of computer viruses (cont’d.)
• Boot virus
• Infects the Master Boot Record
• Adds malicious copycat program to operating system

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Companion virus

11

• Worm

• Worms may:
• Consume resources or
• Leave behind a payload to harm infected systems

• Examples of worm actions

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Malicious program
• Exploits application or operating system vulnerability
• Sends copies of itself to other network devices

• Deleting computer files
• Allowing remote control of a computer by an attacker
12

Table 2-1 Difference between viruses and worms

13

• Trojans
• Program that does something other than advertised
• Typically executable programs
• Sometimes made to appear as data file
• Example
• User downloads “free calendar program”
• Program scans system for credit card numbers and passwords
• Transmits information to attacker through network

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Contain hidden code that launches an attack

14

• Software tools used by an attacker to hide actions or presence of other
types of malicious software
• Hide or remove traces of log-in records, log entries
• May alter or replace operating system files with modified versions:
• Specifically designed to ignore malicious activity

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Rootkits

15

• Rootkits can be detected using programs that compare file contents
with original files
• Rootkits that operate at operating system’s lower levels:
• Removal of a rootkit can be difficult
• Rootkit must be erased
• Original operating system files must be restored
• Reformat hard drive and reinstall operating system

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• May be difficult to detect

16

• Logic bomb
• Computer code that lies dormant

• Difficult to detect before it is triggered

• Backdoor
• Software code that circumvents normal security to give program access
• Common practice by developers
• Intent is to remove backdoors in final application

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Triggered by a specific logical event
• Then performs malicious activities

17

Botnets
Spyware
Adware
Keyloggers

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Types of malware designed to profit attackers

19

• Botnets
• Computer is infected with program that allows it to be remotely
controlled by attacker

• Infected computer called a zombie
• Groups of zombie computers together called botnet

• Early botnet attackers used Internet Relay Chat to remotely control
zombies

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Often payload of Trojans, worms, and viruses

• HTTP is often used today

20

• Botnets’ advantages for attackers
• Operate in the background:
• Provide means for concealing actions of attacker
• Can remain active for years
• Large percentage of zombies are accessible at a given time
• Due to growth of always-on Internet services

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Often with no visible evidence of existence

21

(c) Khaled Mahmud

Table 2-3 Uses of botnets
22

• Spyware

• Advertising
• Collecting personal information
• Changing computer configurations

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Software that gathers information without user consent
• Usually used for:

23

•
•
•
•
•
•

Slows computer performance
Causes system instability
May install new browser menus or toolbars
May place new shortcuts
May hijack home page
Causes increased pop-ups

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Spyware’s negative effects

24

(c) Khaled Mahmud

Table 2-4 Technologies used by spyware

25

• Adware
• Program that delivers advertising content:
• Typically displays advertising banners and pop-up ads
• May open new browser windows randomly
• Can also perform tracking of online activities

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• In manner unexpected and unwanted by the user

26

•
•
•
•

May display objectionable content
Frequent pop-up ads cause lost productivity
Pop-up ads slow computer or cause crashes
Unwanted ads can be a nuisance

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Downsides of adware for users

27

• Program that captures user’s keystrokes
• Information later retrieved by attacker
• Attacker searches for useful information
• Passwords
• Credit card numbers
• Personal information

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Keyloggers

28

• Keyloggers (cont’d.)
• Inserted between computer keyboard and connector
• Unlikely to be detected
• Attacker physically removes device to collect information

(c) Khaled Mahmud

• Can be a small hardware device
