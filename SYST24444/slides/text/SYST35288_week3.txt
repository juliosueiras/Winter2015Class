Responsive Web Design

Why Responsive Web Design?
Almost every new client these days wants
a mobile version of their website.
In the next five years, we’ll likely need to
design for a number of additional
inventions.
In the field of Web design and
development, we’re quickly getting to the
point of being unable to keep up with the
endless new resolutions and devices.

Responsive Web Design-Defined
• Responsive Web design is the
approach that suggests that design
and development should respond
to the user’s behavior and
environment based on screen size,
platform and orientation.
• As the user switches from their
laptop to iPad, the website should
automatically switch to
accommodate for resolution,
image size and scripting abilities.
• This would eliminate the need for
a different design and
development phase for each new
gadget on the market.

Responsive Web Design -SEO Benefits
 One responsive website means
that you can manage one website
with one set of links, without
having to redirect users to
another website where they will
have to deal with server loading
time.


A responsive website improves
SEO and reduces the amount of
maintenance hassle, meaning
there won’t be a drop in your
website speed either. It’s a lot
more stress free for the owner
and the visitor.

ADVANTAGES of Responsive Web Design.
User Experience (UX): Website adjusts to any screen size, making
it a good longterm solution to UX with the current plethora of devices
(including mobile/tablet
hybrids). Hiding elements which aren't crucial for mobile visitors helps
to achieve
their goals faster.
Analytics: One complete view for all the traffic. To get insights on
the mobile
visitors, create a "mobile-only" segment (note that by default, Google
Analytics puts
all the tablets under "Mobile" segment).
Sharing/Linking: One URL to accumulate all of the shares, likes,
tweets, and
inbound links. Contributes to a better user experience as well: have you
ever clicked
on a link in a tweet just to see a mobile version of a page in your full
browser?

SEO: Going with the advantage above, one URL accumulates all links,
PageRank,
Page Authority, etc. However, as Search Engines get smarter at determining
the
relationships between mobile-optimized pages and desktop pages, this
advantage
won't matter.

Development: RWD involves no redirects to take care of, no user-agent
targeting.
Maintenance: Once your website is responsive, there's very little
maintenance
involved, as opposed to up-keeping a separate mobile site. It is not required
to upkeep a user-agent list with all of the up-to-date mobile devices.

Information Architecture (IA): With a 1-to-1 relationship to the
desktop site,
mobile mimics the full site's IA, reducing the learning curve to get
accustomed to
using the mobile version.

Why is it relevant?
It’s about people, not devices
•Yes your iPhone goes to great lengths to
facilitate browsing full sites, but technology
should be available to everyone, even those
without smart phones.
•The most popular devices aren’t necessarily

The future is now:
•Babies have an easier time interacting with an
iPad than with a magazine. To them a print
magazine is just like a broken iPad.
•Websites are not limited to laptops only.

Hello Media Queries and CSS3
In its essence a media
query consists of a media
type and an expression to
check for certain
conditions of a particular
media feature. The most
commonly used media
feature is width.

CSS3 & Media Queries
In your CSS:
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
.content { float: left; }
.social_icons { display: none }
// and so on...
}

CSS3 & Media Queries
On the header of your website:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="this.css"
media="(min-width: 960px)">

CSS3 & Media
Queries

By restricting CSS rules to a certain
width of the device displaying a web
page, one can tailor the page's
representation to devices with varying
screen resolution (view port).

How do we design for RWD
Simple:
Use the Mobile First Approach
and favor Progressive
Enhancement instead of the
traditional Graceful
Degradation

Mobile First
Approach

Mobile First
Approach

Graceful
Degradation
• Focuses on building the website for the most
advanced/capable browsers.
• Older browsers are expected to have a poor,
but passable experience.
• Small fixes may be made to accommodate a
particular browser ( they are not the focus )

Progressive
Enhancement
Progressive Enhancement consists of the
following core principles:
•basic content and functionality should be accessible to all
web browsers
•sparse, semantic markup contains all content
•enhanced layout  external CSS
•enhanced behavior  external JavaScript
•end-user web browser preferences are respected
