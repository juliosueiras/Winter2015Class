For installing the build environment, you need to install first:
    * WINE <http://www.winehq.org/>
    * DOSBOX <http://www.dosbox.com/>

Then run the "makeenv.sh" script:
    ./makeenv.sh

For building a program, just copy the "Makefile" file and the "buildenv"
folder in the source directory:
    asmsrc/buildenv/
    asmsrc/Makefile
    asmsrc/file1.asm
    asmsrc/file2.asm
and run the "make" command:
    make

For launching your compiled program, run the .sh script generated in the
source directory.
