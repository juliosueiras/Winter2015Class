.SH DESCRIPTION

Rotate operand1 left through Carry Flag. The number of rotates is set by operand2.

When immediate is greater then 1, assembler generates several
RCL xx, 1 instructions because 8086 has machine code only for this
instruction (the same principle works for all other shift/rotate instructions).

Algorithm:


	shift all bits left, the bit that goes off is set to
	CF and previous value of CF is inserted to the right-most position.


Example:STC               ; set carry (CF=1).
MOV AL, 1Ch       ; AL = 00011100b
RCL AL, 1         ; AL = 00111001b,  CF=0.
RET



 C O 
 r r 


OF=0 if first operand keeps original sign.
