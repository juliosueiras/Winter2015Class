Shift Arithmetic operand1 Right. The number of shifts is set by operand2.

Algorithm:


	Shift all bits right, the bit that goes off is set to CF.
	The sign bit that is inserted to the left-most position has
	    the same value as before shift.


Example:MOV AL, 0E0h      ; AL = 11100000b
SAR AL, 1         ; AL = 11110000b,  CF=0.

MOV BL, 4Ch       ; BL = 01001100b
SAR BL, 1         ; BL = 00100110b,  CF=0.
