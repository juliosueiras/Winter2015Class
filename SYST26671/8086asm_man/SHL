Shift operand1 Left. The number of shifts is set by operand2.

Algorithm:


	Shift all bits left, the bit that goes off is set to CF.
	Zero bit is inserted to the right-most position.


Example:MOV AL, 11100000b
SHL AL, 1         ; AL = 11000000b,  CF=1.

OF=0 if first operand keeps original sign.
