ROL




^Imemory, immediate
^IREG, immediate
^Imemory, CL
^IREG, CL




Rotate operand1 left. The number of rotates is set by operand2.

Algorithm:


^Ishift all bits left, the bit that goes off is set to
^ICF and the same bit is inserted to the right-most position.


Example:MOV AL, 1Ch       ; AL = 00011100b
ROL AL, 1         ; AL = 00111000b,  CF=0.
RET



 C O 
 r r 


OF=0 if first operand keeps original sign.
