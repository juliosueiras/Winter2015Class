Copy operand2 to operand1.
The MOV instruction cannot:

set the value of the CS and IP registers.
copy value of one segment register to another segment register (should copy to general register first).
copy immediate value to segment register (should copy to general register first).

Algorithm:


operand1 = operand2


Example:
ORG 100h
MOV AX, 0B800h    ; set AX = B800h (VGA memory).
MOV DS, AX        ; copy value of AX to DS.
MOV CL, 'A'       ; CL = 41h (ASCII code).
MOV CH, 01011111b ; CL = color attribute.
MOV BX, 15Eh      ; BX = position on screen.
MOV [BX], CX      ; w.[0B800h:015Eh] = CX.
RET               ; returns to operating system.
