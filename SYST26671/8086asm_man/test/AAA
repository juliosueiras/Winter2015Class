ASCII Adjust after Addition.
Corrects result in AH and AL after addition
when working with BCD values.  It works according to the following Algorithm:


if low nibble of AL > 9 or AF = 1 then:

AL = AL + 6
AH = AH + 1
AF = 1
CF = 1

else

AF = 0
CF = 0

in both cases:
clear the high nibble of AL.

Example:MOV AX, 15   ; AH = 00, AL = 0Fh
AAA          ; AH = 01, AL = 05
