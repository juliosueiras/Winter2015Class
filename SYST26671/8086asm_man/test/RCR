Rotate operand1 right through Carry Flag. The number of rotates is set by operand2.

Algorithm:


^Ishift all bits right, the bit that goes off is set to
^ICF and previous value of CF is inserted to the left-most position.


Example:STC               ; set carry (CF=1).
MOV AL, 1Ch       ; AL = 00011100b
RCR AL, 1         ; AL = 10001110b,  CF=0.
RET



 C O 
 r r 


OF=0 if first operand keeps original sign.
