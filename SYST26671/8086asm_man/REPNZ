REPNZ




	chain instruction




Repeat following CMPSB, CMPSW, SCASB, SCASW instructions
while ZF = 0 (result is Not Zero), maximum CX times.
Algorithm:

check_cx:
if CX &lt;> 0 then

	do following chain instruction
	CX = CX - 1
	if ZF = 0 then:
		
		go back to check_cx
		
	else
		
		exit from REPNZ cycle
		
	

else

	exit from REPNZ cycle
