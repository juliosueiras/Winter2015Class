Rotate operand1 right. The number of rotates is set by operand2.

Algorithm:


	shift all bits right, the bit that goes off is set to
	CF and the same bit is inserted to the left-most position.


Example:MOV AL, 1Ch       ; AL = 00011100b
ROR AL, 1         ; AL = 00001110b,  CF=0.

 C O 
 r r 


OF=0 if first operand keeps original sign.
