  Terms and Conditions for the use of the Netwide Assembler
  =========================================================

  Can I have the gist without reading the legalese?
  -------------------------------------------------

  Basically, NASM is free. You can't charge for it. You can copy it as
  much as you like. You can incorporate it, or bits of it, into other
  free programs if you want. (But we want to know about it if you do,
  and we want to be mentioned in the credits.) We may well allow you
  to incorporate it into commercial software too, but we'll probably
  demand some money for it, and we'll certainly demand to be given
  credit. And in extreme cases (although I can't immediately think of
  a reason we might actually want to do this) we may refuse to let you
  do it at all.

  NASM LICENCE AGREEMENT
  ======================

  By "the Software" this licence refers to the complete contents of
  the NASM archive, excluding this licence document itself, and
  excluding the contents of the `test' directory. The Netwide
  Disassembler, NDISASM, is specifically included under this licence.

  I. The Software is freely redistributable; anyone may copy the
  Software, or parts of the Software, and give away as many copies as
  they like to anyone, as long as this licence document is kept with
  the Software. Charging a fee for the Software is prohibited,
  although a fee may be charged for the act of transferring a copy,
  and you can offer warranty protection and charge a fee for that.

  II. The Software, or parts thereof, may be incorporated into other
  freely redistributable software (by which we mean software that may
  be obtained free of charge) without requiring permission from the
  authors, as long as due credit is given to the authors of the
  Software in the resulting work, as long as the authors are informed
  of this action if possible, and as long as those parts of the
  Software that are used remain under this licence.

  III. Modified forms of the Software may be created and distributed
  as long as the authors are informed of this action if possible, as
  long as the resulting work remains under this licence, as long as
  the modified form of the Software is distributed with documentation
  which still gives credit to the original authors of the Software,
  and as long as the modified form of the Software is distributed with
  a clear statement that it is not the original form of the Software
  in the form that it was distributed by the authors.

  IV. The Software, or parts thereof, may be incorporated into other
  software which is not freely redistributable (i.e. software for
  which a fee is charged), as long as permission is granted from the
  authors of the Software. The authors reserve the right to grant this
  permission only for a fee, which may at our option take the form of
  royalty payments. The authors also reserve the right to refuse to
  grant permission if they deem it necessary. For further information
  about who exactly the authors are, see clause XI below.

  V. The Software may be incorporated, in its original archive form,
  into software collections or archives which are not freely
  redistributable, as long as it is clearly stated that the Software
  itself remains freely redistributable and remains under this licence
  and no other. Such collections are deemed not to fall under article
  IV of this licence.

  VI. Object files or programs generated by the Software as output do
  not fall under this licence at all, and may be placed under any
  licence the author wishes. The authors explicitly lay no claim to,
  and assert no rights over, any programs written by other people and
  assembled into object form by the Software.

  VII. You may not copy, modify or distribute the Software except
  under the terms given in this licence document. You may not
  sublicense the Software or in any way place it under any other
  licence than this one. Since you have not signed this licence, you
  are not of course required to accept it; however, no other licence
  applies to the Software, and nothing else grants you any permission
  to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Software in any way.
  These actions are therefore prohibited if you do not accept this
  licence.

  VIII. There is no warranty for the Software, to the extent permitted
  by applicable law. The authors provide the Software "as is" without
  warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but not
  limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
  a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and
  performance of the Software is with you. Should the Software prove
  defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or
  correction.

  IX. In no event, unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
  writing, will any of the authors be liable to you for damages,
  including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages,
  arising out of the use or the inability to use the Software,
  including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered
  inaccurate or a failure of the Software to operate with any other
  programs, even if you have been advised of the possibility of such
  damages.

  X. In addition to what this Licence otherwise provides, the Software
  may be distributed in such a way as to be compliant with the GNU
  Lesser General Public Licence, as published by the Free Software Foundation,
  Cambridge, MA, USA; version 2.1, or, at your option, any later version;
  incorporated herein by reference.  You must include a copy of this
  Licence with such distribution.  Furthermore, patches sent to the
  authors for the purpose of inclusion in the official release version
  are considered cleared for release under the full terms of this
  Licence.

  XI. The authors of NASM are the original authors (Simon Tatham and
  Julian Hall) and all those who the original authors feel have
  contributed significantly to the overall project.  If you wish to
  contact the authors, Julian Hall (jules@earthcorp.com) should be your
  first port of call.

  XII. Should any part of this agreement be deemed unenforcable, it is
  intended that the remainder of the agreement be held in force.
